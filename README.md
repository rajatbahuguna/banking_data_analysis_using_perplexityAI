# Banking Data Analysis using Perplexity AI

## Project Overview
This repository showcases an end-to-end banking data analytics project that leverages Perplexity AI for synthetic data generation, SQL Server for data transformation and cleaning, and Power BI for rich, interactive reporting and KPI visualization.

## Key Features
- **AI-Assisted Data Generation:** Utilized Perplexity AI to generate SQL scripts for creating a realistic synthetic banking transactions dataset with 10,000+ records featuring typical data quality issues (nulls, duplicates, typos, outliers).
- **SQL Data Transformation:** Scripted data cleansing and consolidation to unify customer, account, and transaction data into a single analytics-ready table.
- **Power BI Reporting:** Developed a professional 2-page Power BI dashboard with diverse, insightful KPIs and dynamic visuals tailored for banking analytics.
- **Data Quality Challenge:** Dataset intentionally includes data inconsistencies to provide hands-on experience with Power BIâ€™s Power Query data cleaning capabilities.
- **Comprehensive KPI Suite:** Includes transactional volume and value trends, customer demographics, account balances, and high-value transaction analysis supported by DAX calculations.

## Repository Contents
- SQL scripts for dataset creation, data population, and transformation.
- DAX measures and visualization guides for Power BI.
- Power BI report files ready for direct deployment.
- Documentation guiding setup, execution, and customization of analytics workflows.

## Technologies Used
- **Perplexity AI:** For generating tailored SQL code.
- **SQL Server:** For data storage, generation, and preprocessing.
- **Power BI:** For interactive data visualization and reporting.

## Future Enhancements
- Enrich dataset with branch-level or geographic data.
- Incorporate machine learning models within Power BI for predictive analytics.
- Automate ETL processes and data refresh using orchestration platforms.
